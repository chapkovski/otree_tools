========================================================================
Set of tools facilitating the development of oTree projects
========================================================================


Installation:
***************
1. **Either**:

- type ``pip install otree_tools -U`` in your terminal window.
(`-U` or `--upgrade` key guarantees that if you already have `otree_tools` installed, it will update it to the most
recent version).


2. **or**:

-  clone exisiting project ``git clone https://github.com/otree-tools/otree_tools`` and copy the
``otree_tools`` folder into your project folder, next to the apps of your module.

3. After that add "otree_tools" to your EXTENSION_APPS section of ``settings.py`` file like this::

    EXTENSION_APPS = ['otree_tools']

If your settings contain other otree extensions, listed in EXTENSION_APSS, just add `otree_tools` into the same list.
The extensions work independently from each other and they will not be in a conflict.

4. If you would like to track time or focused/unfocused time a user spends on a specific page, you need to include
to a standard oTree template a reference to `otree_tools` and then include trackers::

     {% load otree otree_tools %}
     {% block content %}
        {% tracking_focus %}
        {% tracking_time %}
     {% endblock%}

`tracking_focus` and `tracking_time` tags can be included into any block, not necessarily to `content`
